### Why made us create this app?

Our school provides several courses such as web development, UI/UX design, Degital Marketing but we feel these courses are little closed communities. If we collaborate with students in the other courses, we can try to make businesses, get more practical workshops, cultivate experiences. We hope this app helps students carrier and expand their commnunity.

### What was challenging?

- Using a public library: Had to follow their strict library rule.
- Unnecessary rendering: It made me understand well mounting and rendering and also avoid too many renders if it's not needed.
- Auth with cookie by backend: Setting cookie at backend and checking the cookie from frontend to make sure it's robust and stable security.
